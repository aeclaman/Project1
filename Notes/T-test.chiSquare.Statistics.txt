The Difference Between a T-Test & a Chi Square

BOTH are designed to test, and possibly reject, a NULL hypothesis. 
The null hypothesis usually states that something is zero, or does not exist. 
For example, you could test the hypothesis that the difference between two means is zero, or you could test the hypothesis that there is no relationship between two variables.

Null Hypothesis Tested
A T-TEST tests a null hypothesis about two means; 
most often, it tests the hypothesis that two means are equal, 
or that the difference between them is zero. 
For example, whether boys and girls in fourth grade have the same average height.

CHI-SQUARED tests a null hypothesis about the relationship between two variables. 
For example, that men and women are equally likely to vote the same party ticket.


Types of Data
A T-TEST requires two variables; 
	one must be categorical and have exactly two levels, 
	the other must be quantitative and be estimable by a mean. 
For example, Republican or Democrat, and age.

A CHI-SQUARE test requires categorical variables, usually only two, 
	but each may have any number of levels. 
For example, ethnic groups and presidential choice.



Variations
There are variations of the T-TEST to cover 
	paired data; for example, husbands and wives, or right and left eyes. 

There are variations of the CHI-SQUARED to deal with 
	ordinal data -- like "none," "a little," "some," "a lot" â€” 
	more than two variables.

Conclusions
The T-TEST allows you to say EITHER 
	"we <<can reject>> the null hypothesis of <<equal means>> at the 0.05 level" OR 
	"we <<have insufficient evidence to reject>> the null of equal means at the 0.05 level." 
A CHI-SQUARE test allows you to say EITHER 
	"we <<can reject>> the null hypothesis of <<no relationship>> at the 0.05 level" OR 
	"we have insufficient evidence to reject the null at the 0.05 level."
