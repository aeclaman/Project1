Note: These data are based on information from all death certificates filed in the 50 
States and the District of Columbia. The mortality data files are maintained by the 
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Rates for decennial years were calculated using U.S. Census Bureau 
decennial census counts; population estimates produced by the Census Bureau 
were used for noncensus years. The NCHS revised the cause of death coding 
beginning in 1999. The user is cautioned when making trend comparisons of data 
from 1999 and later to those from 1998 and earlier; observed changes in numbers 
or rates may be the result of the coding revisions.
     Suicide rates for ages under 10 years have been omitted because of low 
incidence. A category including cases where the age is unknown also has been 
omitted; this category also comprises a small number of cases each year. Some 
data have been revised by the Source and may differ from previous editions of 
SOURCEBOOK.
