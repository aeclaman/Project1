Note: These data are based on information from all death certificates filed in the 50 States ,,,,,,,
and the District of Columbia. The mortality data files are maintained by the National Center ,,,,,,,
for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Rates for ,,,,,,,
decennial years were calculated using U.S. Census Bureau decennial census counts; ,,,,,,,
population estimates produced by the Census Bureau were used for noncensus years. The ,,,,,,,
NCHS revised the cause of death coding beginning in 1999. The user is cautioned when ,,,,,,,
making trend comparisons of data from 1999 and later to those from 1998 and earlier; ,,,,,,,
observed changes in numbers or rates may be the result of the coding revisions. Some data ,,,,,,,
have been revised by the Source and may differ from previous editions of SOURCEBOOK.,,,,,,,
